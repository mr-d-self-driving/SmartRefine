This repository contains code for the paper [SmartRefine: An Scenario-Adaptive Refinement Framework for Efficient Motion Prediction](https://github.com/opendilab/SmartRefine). We will release the code soon. 

This work introduces a novel approach to refining motion predictions in autonomous vehicle navigation by leveraging scenario-specific properties and adaptive refinement iterations. Comprehensive studies are also conducted to ablate design choices and explore the mechanism behind multi-iteration refinement.
